# Plain Text Diagram - Syntax Highlighting 

This extension provides syntax highlighting for PT Diagrams, a simple language for creating diagrams in a text editor. 

Search for `plain-text-diagrams` on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace to install.

## Features

Syntax highlighting for `.ptd` files.

PT Diagrams is a simple language for creating diagrams in a text editor. It is inspired by PlantUML and Graphviz, but is much simpler and more focused on the needs of software developers.

## Requirements

Just open a file with a `.ptd` or `.pt-diagram` extension.

## Extension Settings

None

## Known Issues

Some aspects of the syntax highlighting could be improved, like expressions.

Highlighting of brackets inside text descriptions is not perfect. This is because the vscode setting
```
editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled
```
is causing yellow bracket highlighting despite my grammar. In other words, its not the fault of the grammar, but the fault of the vscode setting.

Solution is to disable bracket pair colorization in your settings.json:

```json
"[ptd]": {
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false
}
```

## Release Notes

## Specification

### Plain Text Diagram (PT Diagram) Notation

#### **Purpose**
A lightweight, plain text format for visualizing software systems, including classes, files, variables, functions, relationships, and use cases. Designed for readability, version control, and LLM compatibility.

#### **Sections**

Broadly, the PT Diagram notation consists of the following sections:
```
Diagram:
Files:
Classes:
Class Relationships:
Imports:
Use Cases:
  Scenario: A
  Scenario: B
```

Indentation: Critical for hierarchy and readability. Use `-->` for relationships. Use `->` for function calls in use cases. Use `< returnType` for function return types. Various annotations 

1. **Diagram**: System name, version, description, and files.
   ```plaintext
   Diagram:
     name: Diagram Name
     version: 1.0
     description: Brief description.
     files: File1.ts, File2.ts
   ```

2. **Files**: Lists variables, functions (with parameters, return types, and annotations), and classes/interfaces for each file. Comments can be added using `#`. The file: objects are like UML boxes with data + behaviour e.g. Variables: and Functions:. Additional sections for Classes: and Interfaces: can be added if needed. Variables can have optional default values with `= defaultValue`, and optional relationships with `(relationship, cardinality)`.  Functions can be listed as (private).
    ```plaintext
    Files:
      file: File1.ts
        Variables:
          var1: Type # Example comment
          var2: Type = 100 # Optional default value
          var3: Type (0..1) # Optional cardinality
          var3: Type (contains, 1..*) # Optional relationship

        Functions:
          func1(param1: Type, param2: Type): ReturnType
          func2(): void @override # Overrides a parent class method
          func3(): number (private)
        Classes:
          Class1
        Interfaces:
          Interface1
    ```

3. **Classes**: Describes classes and interfaces, including their attributes, methods (with parameters, return types, and annotations), and relationships (inheritance or implementation). The class: object is like a UML box with data + behaviour e.g. Attributes: and Methods:. The interface: object is like a class but with no methods.  Attributes can have optional default values with `= defaultValue`, and optional relationships with `(relationship, cardinality)`. Class and Interface names can optionally be followed by (somefile.ts) indicating their location.
   ```plaintext
    Classes:
      class: Class1 (class1.ts) --> ParentClass (parent.ts) (inherits|implements)
        Attributes:
          attr1: Type # Example comment
          attr2: Type = 100  # Optional default value
          attr3: Type (0..1) # Optional cardinality
          attr3: Type (owns, 1) # Optional relationship and cardinality
        Methods:
          method1(param1: Type, param2: Type): ReturnType
          method2(): void @override # Overrides a parent method
      interface: Interface1
        Methods:
          method1(param1: Type): ReturnType
   ```

4. **Class Relationships**: Describes relationships between classes and interfaces, including optional relationship annotation (uses, contains, owns, etc.) and optional cardinality (e.g., 1, 1..*, 0..1). Single or multiple relationships. If one relationship, use `Class1 --> Class2 (relationship)`. For multiple relationships, indent the relationships under the class.  Nested relationships are indented further.
   ```plaintext
   Class Relationships:
     Class1
       --> Class2 (inherits)
       --> Class3 (implements)
     Class4 --> Class5 (depends on)
     Class6
       --> Class7 (contains, 1..*)
       --> Class8 (creates, 1)
         --> Class9 (owns, 0..1)
   ```

5. **Imports**: Dependencies between files. Files one per line. List the contents of each file in () e.g. `File1.ts (class Class1, function func1)` indent the relationships under the file using -->. Multiple relationships are indented under the file at the same level. Nested relationships are indented further.
   ```plaintext
Imports:
  Car.ts (class Car, function start, function stop)
    --> Automobile.ts (interface Automobile)
  ElectricCar.ts (class ElectricCar, function charge)
    --> Car.ts (class Car, function start)
    --> Charger.ts (class Charger, function chargeCar)
      --> Utils.ts (function calculatePower)
    ```

6. **Use Cases**:  Use Case Notation describes high-level scenarios combining sequence diagrams with descriptive pseudo-code. Core syntax: Function calls follow indented format `-> functionName(params) [class ClassName, File.ts]` with source annotations [source class (if applicable), filename]. Return types appear on a new line as `< returnType` followed by optional `, variable =` to specify where result is stored; `< void` is optional for no return value. Returns can be primitives or complex objects like `< {prop: type}`. Control flow uses bracketed annotations [if], [else], [loop], [parallel], [try], [catch], [finally], [recurse] with nesting shown through indentation and arrows (`->`) indicating nested function calls. Variables are referenced in backticks (e.g. `` `variableName` ``) with state updates described in natural language, focusing on key changes and purpose rather than detailed assignments. The notation prioritizes high-level abstraction and "what" over "how", using natural language summaries for logic and state changes while retaining clear function call notation. Since use cases begin with a function call, they can serve as documentation for function behavior itself. Bullet points (-) can be used to list sequential actions.async function calls can be preceded by e.g. `-> await function1()`. 
Indenting is typically two spaces, indented `-> function()` call lines are matched with corresponding `< type` line which is on its own line and indented more than the initialting parent call. It is impossible for there to be lines at the same indent level as a returning `< type` line. [if condition] and other annotations like [try] are followed by a `-> function()` line or psudo code descriptive text which is indented, like the way a regular if or try statements work.
Example:
```
   Use Cases:
     Scenario: Example Scenario
       func1() [class Class1, File1.ts]         Initializes `this.snippetTree` and `this.itemTree` as empty structures.
         [if condition]
           -> func2() [class Class2, File2.ts]
             Updates `this.itemTree` with the constructed tree structure.
             Stores the tree in `this.languageIdTrees` for the given language.
             < returnType, x =
           -> blend(fruit: Fruit) [class Smoothie, Smoothie.ts]              < string, currentFruit =
           -> await fsp.readdir(extensionsPath) [fs.promises]
             < string[], extensionsDirs = 
         < returnType
```
